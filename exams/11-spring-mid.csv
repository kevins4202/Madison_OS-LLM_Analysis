In this control flow, the user process encounters a TLB
 miss during its execution. The TLB miss triggers a control
 transfer to the OS, which is responsible for handling the 
TLB miss. The OS then transfers control to the VMM, 
which manages the virtual machine environment.

During the TLB miss handling, the VMM updates the 
TLB with the required translation information. Once the
 TLB has been updated, control is transferred back to 
the OS, which, in turn, transfers control back to the user 
process. The user process can then continue its execution
 with the updated TLB, ensuring efficient virtual memory access.",7.0,"The CPU generates a virtual address.
The CPU checks the TLB to see if the virtual address is mapped to a physical address.
If the virtual address is not mapped to a physical address, then a TLB miss occurs.
The CPU sends a page fault interrupt to the operating system.
The operating system handles the page fault by loading the page into memory.
The operating system updates the TLB with the mapping for the page.
The CPU resumes execution.",7.0

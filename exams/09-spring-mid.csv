(i) A smarter policy for this system could be the Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm. ",6.0,"(a) The time to compute the schedule for an SJF (Shortest Job First) Policy is Sort(3) = 30 seconds.

(b) The time to run the jobs once the schedule has been computed is 30 + 20 + 10 = 60 seconds.

(c) The average response time for each job is 60 / 3 = 20 seconds.

(d) The average turnaround time for each job is 60 + 20 = 80 seconds.

(e) The average response time for each job is 70 / 3 = 23.33 seconds.

(f) The average turnaround time for each job is 70 + 23.33 = 93.33 seconds.

(g) The average response time for each job is 50 / 5 = 10 seconds.

(h) The average turnaround time for each job is 60 + 10 = 70 seconds.

(i) A smarter policy for this system would be to use a round-robin scheduling algorithm. This algorithm would not require any sorting, and the switching overhead would be the same for each job. The average response time would be 60 / 5 = 12 seconds, and the average turnaround time would be 70 / 5 = 14 seconds.

Here is a table summarizing the results:

Scheduling Algorithm	Sorting Time	Switching Time	Response Time	Turnaround Time
SJF (Shortest Job First)	30 seconds	0 seconds	20 seconds	80 seconds
SJF (Shortest Job First)	30 seconds	10 seconds	23.33 seconds	93.33 seconds
Round-Robin	0 seconds	10 seconds	12 seconds	14 seconds

ms,"(a) The base register is used to store the starting address of a segment in memory.
(b) The address in the base register is a physical address.
(c) The bounds register is used to store the size or limit of a segment.
(d) We need more than one base/bounds register pair to support multiple segments
 in memory. Each pair corresponds to a different segment, allowing the system to 
manage and protect different regions of memory independently.
(e) The hardware should support as many segments as required by the operating 
system and applications. The number of segments depends on the memory
 requirements of the system, the level of memory virtualization needed, and the 
design choices of the hardware and operating system. There is no fixed number of 
segments that the hardware must support.

(i) If the programmer had been more careful to avoid crashing, they would have 
ensured that ptr does not exceed the bounds of the segments. In this case, the 
legal physical addresses generated by dereferencing ptr would be within the valid
 range of the segment boundaries. For segment 0, the legal physical addresses 
would be in the range 1024 - 1323, and for segment 1, the legal physical addresses
 would be in the range 4704 - 5003.



",11.0,"(a) A base register is a register that stores the starting address of a segment in memory.

(b) The address in the base register is a virtual address.

(c) The bounds register stores the size of a segment in memory.

(d) We need more than one base/bounds register pair because each process needs its own segment registers.

(e) The hardware should support as many segments as there are processes in the system. This 
is because each process needs its own segment registers.

(f) The virtual addresses generated by this program at LINE 1 by dereferencing ptr are 20, 40, 60, 
80, 100, and 120.

(g) This program will run for 6 iterations before crashing. This is because the last virtual address 
generated by the program is 120, which is beyond the bounds of segment 0.

(h) The physical addresses generated by dereferencing ptr before the program crashes are 1024,
 1004, 984, 964, 944, and 924.

(i) The legal physical addresses that could have been generated by dereferencing ptr, if the 
programmer had been more careful to avoid crashing, are 1004, 984, 964, 944, and 924.

Here is a diagram that shows the virtual and physical addresses generated by the program:",6
m,"(a) The offset portion of the virtual address has 10 bits.
(b) The VPN portion of the virtual address has 22 bits.
(c) The number of entries in a linear page table is 2^22.
(d) The total size of the linear page table is 2^22 * 4 bytes.
(e) The memory occupied by page tables depends on the size of the address 
space and the number of pages mapped.
(f) The number of PTEs that fit onto a single page is 256.
(g) The VPNChunkIndex requires 8 bits.
(h) The VPNPageDir requires 14 bits.

(j) Multi-level page table size: Depends on specific implementation. Linear page
 table size: 2^32 * 4 bytes.
(k) Multi-level page table size: Depends on specific implementation.
(l) Multi-level page table size: Depends on specific implementation. Linear page
 table size: 2^32 * 4 bytes.",14.5,"(a) There are 10 bits in the offset portion of the virtual address. This is because 2^10 = 1024, 
which is the size of a 1KB page.

(b) There are 22 bits in the VPN portion of the virtual address. This is because 32 - 10 = 22.

(c) There are 2^22 = 4194304 entries in the page table. This is because the VPN is 22 bits wide, 
so there are 2^22 possible values for the VPN.

(d) The total size of the page table is 4194304 * 4 = 16777216 bytes. This is because each page 
table entry is 4 bytes in size, and there are 4194304 entries in the page table.

(e) In a live system, the amount of memory occupied by page tables is affected by the number of 
processes in the system and the amount of memory each process uses. The more processes there
 are in the system, the more page tables there will be, and the more memory will be used by page 
tables. The more memory each process uses, the more page table entries will be used by each 
process, and the more memory will be used by page tables.

(f) There are 1024 PTEs that fit onto a single page in this system. This is because the page size is 
1KB, and each PTE is 4 bytes in size, so there are 1KB / 4 bytes/PTE = 1024 PTEs per page.

(g) There are 10 bits needed in the VPNChunkIndex. This is because the page table is divided into 
1024 chunks, and each chunk is indexed by a 10-bit number.

(h) There are 22 - 10 = 12 bits needed in the VPNPageDir. This is because the VPN is divided into 
two parts: the VPNPageDir and the VPNChunkIndex. The VPNPageDir is 12 bits wide, and the 
VPNChunkIndex is 10 bits wide, so the total size of the VPN is 12 + 10 = 22 bits.

(i) The amount of memory needed for the page directory is 4096 bytes. This is because the page 
directory is a page, and each page is 4096 bytes in size.

(j) The multi-level page table consumes 4096 + 3 * 4 = 4104 bytes. The linear page table consumes
 4096 * 4 = 16384 bytes.

(k) The multi-level page table consumes 4096 + 1000 * 4 = 41004 bytes. The linear page table 
consumes 4096 * 1001 = 4096004 bytes.

(l) The multi-level page table consumes 4096 + 4194304 * 4 = 16777792 bytes. The linear page 
table consumes 4096 * 4194305 = 167772160 bytes.",10

s,"(a) Virtual machine monitors (VMMs) are needed because the OS alone does not 
fully virtualize the hardware. VMMs provide an additional layer of virtualization, 
allowing multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run concurrently on a single physical machine.

(b) The abstractions presented by a virtual machine to the OS differ from the 
abstraction presented by the OS to an application in terms of scope and privilege. 
VMs abstract an entire virtualized environment, while the OS abstracts the underlying
 hardware resources.

(c) The abstractions provided by both the OS to an application and a virtual machine
 to the OS share similarities in terms of encapsulation and isolation.

(d) TLB misses are slow when the OS is running on a VMM because the VMM 
introduces an additional layer of address translation, resulting in longer latency.

(e) Yes, the VMM needs a similar page table structure per operating system to track
 virtual-to-physical translations for each virtual machine.

(f) The VMM performs a similar operation to the OS in terms of context switching, 
saving and restoring the state of virtual machines.

(g) The lack of insight into what the OS is doing can make resource management 
decisions more difficult for the VMM, affecting allocation, distribution, and performance
 optimization among VMs.",15.0,"(a) To run multiple OSes on the same hardware.

(b) OS sees a virtualized view of hardware, limited resources. VM sees a set of virtualized resources.

(c) Both provide a layer of abstraction between software and hardware. VM's abstraction is more complex.

(d) VMM must translate virtual address to physical address before accessing memory.

(e) VMM doesn't need a separate page table per OS. OS's page table tracks virtual-to-physical translations for apps.

(f) VMM performs a similar operation to a context switch when switching between guest OSes.

(g) VMMs have a hard time managing resources because they don't know what the OS is doing.

(h) Example: VMM may not know how much memory OS is using, so it may not be able to allocate enough memory to other guest OSes.

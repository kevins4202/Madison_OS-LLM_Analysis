cm,"(a) 64 KB = 64 * 1024 bytes = 64 * 2^10 bytes = 64 * 2^(10+3) bits = 64 * 2^13 bits.
Therefore, there are 13 bits in a virtual address in this system.

(b) Since the virtual address has 13 bits, and the page size is 8 KB (which is 2^13
 bytes), the VPN will be the 13 most significant bits of the virtual address.

(c) The offset will be the 13 least significant bits of the virtual address.

(d) Number of pages = 64 KB / 8 KB = 2^13 / 2^10 = 2^(13-10) = 2^3 = 8.
Therefore, the linear page table will contain 8 entries.

(a) In this case, the page size is 4 bytes, and the virtual address space is still 64 KB.
64 KB = 64 * 1024 bytes = 64 * 2^10 bytes = 64 * 2^(10+3) bits = 64 * 2^13 bits.
Therefore, there are 13 bits in a virtual address in this system.

(b) The VPN will consist of the 13 most significant bits of the virtual address.

(c) In this case, the offset will be the 2 least significant bits of the virtual address.

(d) Number of pages = 64 KB / 4 bytes = 2^13 / 2^2 = 2^(13-2) = 2^11 = 2048.
Therefore, the linear page table will contain 2048 entries.

struct pte *find_pte(void *pt_base, int VPN) {
    // Calculate the physical address of the page table entry (PTE)
    struct pte *p = (struct pte*)((char*)pt_base + VPN * sizeof(struct pte));
    return p;
}",10,"The size of the virtual address space is 64 KB, which is 64 * 1024 = 65536 bytes.
 The page size is 8 KB, so the number of bits in a virtual address is log2(65536) + log2(8) = 16 + 3 = 19 bits

Part (b) The virtual page number (VPN) is the most significant part of the virtual address.
 It is the number of the page that the virtual address refers to. In this case, the VPN is 18 bits long.

Part (c) The offset is the least significant part of the virtual address. It is the offset within the
 page that the virtual address refers to. In this case, the offset is 2 bits long.

Part (d) The number of entries in the linear page table is equal to the number of virtual pages.
 In this case, the number of virtual pages is 65536 / 4 = 16384, so the linear page table contains 16384 entries.

(a) Number of bits in a virtual address: 16
(b) Number of bits in the VPN: 12
(c) Number of bits in the offset: 4
(d) Number of entries in the linear page table: 16384

(a) The SJF policy schedules the shortest job first. Since job A requires 10 seconds
 of CPU time and job B requires 15 seconds, job A will finish before job B starts. 
So, job B will finish after 15 seconds.

(b) The LJF policy schedules the longest job first. In this case, job B is the longest 
job with a CPU time requirement of 15 seconds. Therefore, job B will finish after 15 seconds.

(c) In a round-robin policy with a time slice length of 1 second, each job gets to run
 for 1 second before being preempted and allowing the next job to run. Therefore,
job A will finish after 10 seconds.

(d) In a round-robin policy with a time-slice length of 1 second, each job gets 
to run for 1 second before being preempted and allowing the next job to run. 
Job B needs 15 seconds of CPU time.Therefore, job B will finish after 10 seconds.

(e) Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, job B will finish after 10 seconds.

(f) Since job C needs 10 seconds of CPU time, the time-slice should be larger than 10 seconds for job B to finish before job C. Any time-slice larger than 10 seconds will ensure that job B finishes before job C.In summary, for job B to finish before job C in a round-robin policy, the time-slice should be greater than 10 seconds.
(a) To make the OS make the worst decisions in terms of achieving the lowest average response time, the user should provide the estimates such that the longest job (job B) is estimated to have the shortest runtime, and the shortest job (job A) is estimated to have the longest runtime.

(b) The average response time for a job is the time from when it arrives until it starts executing. In the worst-case scenario described in part (a), the SJF policy will schedule job A first since it has the highest estimated runtime. Job A will complete its execution in 10 seconds and then job B will start executing for 15 seconds.

Therefore, the average response time for job A will be (0 + 10) / 2 = 5 seconds, and the average response time for job B will be (10 + 25) / 2 = 17.5 seconds.

(c) The average response time for job B will be (0 + 20) / 2 = 10 seconds.
The average response time for job A will be (20 + 30) / 2 = 25 seconds.
The average response time for job C will be (35 + 40) / 2 = 37.5 seconds.

(d) 
In this case, the runtime of job B should be changed to 10 seconds, which is the same as job A's runtime. By making job B's runtime equal to job A's runtime, we ensure that job B finishes before job A, regardless of the estimates provided by the users.",6,"(a) Under SJF, the jobs will be scheduled in the order A, B, C. Since B is the second job to 
arrive, it will start running after A has finished. The total time that A needs is 10 seconds, 
so B will start running 10 seconds after A arrives. B needs 15 seconds to finish, so it will 
finish 15 seconds after it starts running. Therefore, B will finish at time 10 + 15 = 25 seconds.

(b) Under LJF, the jobs will be scheduled in the order B, A, C. Since B is the second job to
 arrive, it will start running after A has finished. The total time that A needs is 10 seconds, 
so B will start running 10 seconds after A arrives. B needs 15 seconds to finish, so it will 
finish 15 seconds after it starts running. Therefore, B will finish at time 10 + 15 = 25 seconds.

(c) Under round-robin, each job is given a time slice of 1 second. When the time slice expires,
 the job is preempted and the next job in the queue is scheduled. Job A will need 10 seconds 
to finish, so it will be scheduled 10 times. Each time it is scheduled, it will run for 1 second 
before being preempted. Therefore, job A will finish at time 10 + 1 = 11 seconds.

(d) Job B will need 15 seconds to finish, so it will be scheduled 15 times. Each time it is 
scheduled, it will run for 1 second before being preempted. Therefore, job B will finish at 
time 15 + 1 = 16 seconds.

(e) The time it takes for job B to finish will depend on the length of the time slice. If the time 
slice is 1 second, then job B will finish at time 16 seconds. If the time slice is 2 seconds, then 
job B will finish at time 15 seconds. If the time slice is any other value less than or equal to 
2 seconds, then job B will finish at some time between 15 and 16 seconds.

(f) Job B will finish before job C if the time slice is less than or equal to 10 
seconds. If the time slice is 10 seconds, then job B and C will finish at the same time. If the 
time slice is greater than 10 seconds, then job C will finish before job B.

(a) Job A: 10 seconds
Job B: 20 seconds
Job C: 15 seconds

(b) Job A: 15 seconds
Job B: 35 seconds
Job C: 25 seconds
In this case, job A spends 15 seconds waiting in the queue, job B spends 35 seconds waiting in the queue, and job C spends 25 seconds waiting in the queue. The total time that all three jobs spend waiting in the queue is 75 seconds, so the average response time is 75 / 3 = 25 seconds.

(c) Job A: 10 seconds
Job B: 25 seconds
Job C: 20 seconds
In this case, job A spends 10 seconds waiting in the queue, job B spends 25 seconds waiting in the queue, and job C spends 20 seconds waiting in the queue. The total time that all three jobs spend waiting in the queue is 55 seconds, so the average response time is 55 / 3 = 18.33 seconds.

(d) If we can arbitrarily change the run-time of job B, the run-time that should be changed to so that SJF delivers the best average response time to jobs A, B, and C, even if there are bad estimates is:
